# My Portfolio
Example website with a projects' portfolio.
## Known issues
- it would be nice to have a left and right padding in "About me" section. Adding a padding was causing styling issues.
- Featured Work section, when all 3 projects are in one row, it would be good to float the first picture to the left and
the third one to the right. Unfortunately, it was causing size issues - middle picture was significantly smaller than the other ones.
